                <p class="p-black mx-3">
                    Sponsoring a child is a wonderful way to help change the life of a child in need and
                    bring hope to his or her entire community. By becoming a sponsor you will provide
                    desperately needed opportunities to a bright child with incredible potentials.
                    Sponsoring a child provides basic needs like education, food and clothing.

                <p class="p-black mx-3">
                    Many families and schools in Nigeria do not have the needed resources to ensure that
                    the children are able to attend schools and graduate, as well as receive a quality
                    education. We are reinforcing and boosting education by providing the badly needed
                    supporting structures and resources. This includes provision of tuition, uniforms and
                    school supplies

                    Providing educational support is a tested and proven way to impact lives by providing
                    the vital knowledge and skills that the child needs to grow up, become independent,
                    self-sufficient and able to contribute to their community, national and global
                    development.

                    The cost of sponsoring the child's education can be overwhelming for impoverished
                    families. Some of the families who are struggling economically are not in a position to
                    cover all expenses. In such instances, without the support of a sponsor, the parents
                    would not be able to pay school fees or purchase uniforms etc. The added burden of
                    uniforms, school supplies etc. has made kids start school late or completely dropped
                    out of school. Child sponsors are not just charity providers, they have been answers to
                    prayers for many families-meeting a vital need and ensuring that children are able to
                    stay in school.

                <p class="p-black">
                    Once a child has a sponsor or is matched with a sponsor, A.I.M.S. spins a cocoon of
                    support, education and protection throughout his or her education. Donations
                    provided by sponsors pay for anything that is needed forthe child to be in school, do
                    well in school and stay in school. If desired, sponsors can establish a one-on-one
                    relationship with the child theyhave chosen to sponsor.

                    Sponsorship costs N20, 000 Twenty Thousand Naira for a full year(N5, 000 per term

                    Each student is assigned a supervisor who meets with the student and the family
                    throughout the year to oversee the students' progress by checking their report
                    cards and address any potential hindrances to the student's academic success.
                    The supervisor also makes sure that the money dispensed to the student is only
                    spent to remove obstacles that would prevent the student from staying and
                    succeeding in school.
